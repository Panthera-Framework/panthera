Panthera Framework 2
========

Assumptions for second version:

- Deployment
- Automatic code analysis to keep the project in single coding style
- Automatic tests
- Separate driver/orm code for SQLite3, MySQL databases
- Base code + separate support for RainTPL4 and a place for other templating engines
- Plug & Play modules
- Integration with Unix (incron and crontab to be automaticaly setup by application - a deployment job would be need here)
- Simpler admin panel
- Simpler modules for creating pages like "business cards" eg. data automaticaly loaded from Excel or PDF and displayed on page
that is formatted by a templating engine
