panthera
========

Simple web framework written in PHP, designed to be simple as possible, modular and easy to use. Inspired by Wordpress.

Notice
=======

Panthera is under highly development. We are doing everything to make it usable for everyone outside of our Panthera developers group. Please be patient.
We plan a composer integration, better shell tools (for projects management) and a Panthera installer to split it all together.
